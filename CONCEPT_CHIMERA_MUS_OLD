Inspiration
A mix of MUD gaming and agent-based simulation (ABS). Inspired by MUDs where 
players can join simply through telnet. Big difference is that there is more 
focus on the simulation aspect than on the dungeon aspect, therefore it is 
named erlMUS for "Erlang Multi-User Simulation".
The inspiration from the simulation side is the Sugarscape simulation where 
agents move around in a 2 dimensional discrete world and engage with each other
to contract and pass on diseases, mate with each other, lend and borrow 
ressources, pollute the environment,... 

The Player
- Each player starts with same initial properties: 
  -> Health: 100 points, when reaching 0 the player dies.
  -> 2 Resource slot: Each slot can carry 100 resources of any type. Initially
     100 resources.
  -> Metabolism rate: The amount of resources the metabolism of the player 
     needs per time-unit to sustain the player. Initially it is 0.027 per second
     which means the player will start to starve after around 3600 time units if no 
     resources are found.
  -> Starvation rate: The amount of health drained per time unit if the player
     runs out of resources.
  -> 10 Item slots: each slot can hold one item of any type.
- A player consumes resources automatically over time due to its metabolism. rate 
- Moving from one room to another needs resources as well, depending on the room
- If a player has drained all its resources, it will slowly start to take damage
  according to the starvation rate.
- If a players health reaches 0 it will die and start again at the center.

The Environment
- resources grow in each room with varying rate and can be picked up by any player
- picking up resources causes pollution by the following formula:
  TODO
- pollution diffuses to other rooms if players move between polluted rooms.
- pollution reduces the regrow rate of the room AND increases the metabolsim and
  starvation rate of the players by the following formula:
    TODO
- pollution disolves over time by a rate of 0.1 per second.

Player-Player Interaction
- players can revive other players if one has died by sacrificing resources
- players can say and ask words in a room which all the players in that room
  can hear.

[ ] world inspired by the Cube movies: split into discrete cubes, with connections changing over time. cubes can have a beneficial, neutral or dangerous Environment e.g.: healing effect, time warp, poison.
[ ] mixed setting: sci-fi, fantasy, real-world
[ ] no classes?
[ ] npc Roaming around, also give Insights into the behaviour of the system
[ ] pvp possible
[ ] cubes connected through Portals with various colors
[ ] Players need to figure out together how the world evolves over time and influence it by their actionsto prevent death of themselves, others and the world itself
[ ] the changes follow and underlying algorithm but the world reveales information about it in various places so that Players can figure out the changes going to happen
[ ] goal: don't die, get to the exit. if you reach the exit, you will get a special reward (todo) and will get reset
